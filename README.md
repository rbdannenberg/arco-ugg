# arco
Yet another Unit Generator library, with control via O2.

Try this:

`cd ugg`
`python3 ugtest.py`

Use CMake in `ugg/src/framework` to generate a project file.

Compile the project (`uggtest`)

Subdirectories:

- `arco` has code to test O2 intra-process/inter-thread communication

- `ugg` has Unit Generator Generator code (UGG itself and tests)
